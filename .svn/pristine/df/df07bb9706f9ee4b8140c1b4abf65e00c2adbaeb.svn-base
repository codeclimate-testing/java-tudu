Database setup

* Introduction

  Tudu Lists is using the {{{http://www.hibernate.org}Hibernate}} persistence layer, 
  so it should work seamlessly on most databases (in fact, we have seen it working 
  with Postgresql, MaxDB, HSQLDB and Oracle).

  However, developement is focused on the MySQL database for the following reasons :

    * It's Open Source,

    * It's working on a lot of operating systems,
  
    * It's easy to install,
  
    * It's easy to develop on (a lot easier than Oracle),
  
    * It is ready for production (it's fast and cluster-ready).
  
* MySQL installation

  Download MySQL at {{http://www.mysql.com/}}, and follow the instructions in order 
  to install the database.
  
  If you're using Windows or Mac OS X, an easy-to-use graphical installer is provided.

  If you're running Linux, chances are that MySQL is already running on your system, 
  or that a simple "apt-get install mysql" will do the trick.

* Database installation

  Now that MySQL is installed, let's create the "tudu" database.

  Using a graphical front-end could help for following the next steps. There are a lot 
  of different front-ends for MySQL, but you could use :

    * MySQL Query Browser : {{http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/query-browser/}}
  
    * CocoaMySQL (only works on Mac OS X, but is really great) : {{http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/}}

  Now follow the next steps (we're using MySQL Query Browser in the screenshots) :

  Step 1 : create the "tudu" schema.

  Step 2 : In the "tudu" database, open the create_schema_mysql.sql script. This script is provided in 
  the "src/sql/" directory of each Tudu Lists distribution (Note that before version 1.1.1, is was in 
  stored in the "sql/" directory). If you want the latest version of this script, it is available in the 
  {{{http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/tudu/tudu/src/sql/}CVS repository}}.

  Step 3 : Execute the script (with MySQL Query Browser, click on the green "Execute" icon).

  You should now have a ready-to-work version of the "tudu" database :
