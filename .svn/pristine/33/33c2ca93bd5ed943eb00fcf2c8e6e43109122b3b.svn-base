Eclipse setup

* Introduction

  Tudu Lists' official development platform is the {{{http://www.eclipse.org}Eclipse}} IDE. 
  We have also been using {{{http://www.intellij.com/}Intellij IDEA}}, and you could probably 
  develop Tudu Lists with any other Java editor, however we have decided that Eclipse is the 
  official supported IDE, and we will focus exclusively on it. This means that Eclipse-specific 
  configuration files will be stored in CVS, and none other.

* Checking out the project from CVS

  Go to the CVS perspective, and create a new repository location.  Use the following configuration :

    * Host : tudu.cvs.sourceforge.net
    
    * Repository location : /cvsroot/tudu
    
    * user : anonymous
  
  Just select the HEAD (or the tag/branch you wish to work on), and right-click on "checkout".

* Building the project

  Once the project is checked out from CVS, you will need to run Maven in order to download 
  the project's dependencies.

  Install Maven 2 from {{http://maven.apache.org/}} and open a console into your Tudu Lists 
  installation directory.
  
  Just type "mvn package war:inplace" to download all dependencies and create an exploded WAR 
  of Tudu Lists.

  Add an Eclipse "classpath variable", called "M2_REPO", which points to your Maven local 
  repository (by default ~/.m2/repository). The Tudu Lists project should now compile in Eclipse.

* Eclipse Web Tools Platform

  The Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) is an Eclipse plugin, available on the 
  {{{http://www.eclipse.org}Eclipse website}}, which helps creating web applications. For instance, 
  it adds JSP and XML support, and integrates with several application servers, including Tomcat and Geronimo.

  We are officially supporting WTP, and will commit any relevant configuration files into CVS.
